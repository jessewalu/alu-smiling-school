# ALU Smiling School
> Implementing a design with Bootstrap

## 📖 Description

This project is an implementation of a responsive web design for the ALU Smiling School using Bootstrap. The goal is to create fully functional web pages that match the designer's specifications, incorporating HTML, CSS, accessibility, and responsive design principles.
